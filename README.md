# Password Generator Starter Code
During this challenge I was pushed more than I have been with any other challenge. My biggest struggle was figuring out the terminology and special characters gave me a bit of an issue too. My TA's, advisor, and tutors were able to support me throughout this challenge and help me understand things differently. Javascript in itself has been a challenge and often times I will refer back to the modules, Youtube videos, and Google to help advance me to the next step. This challenge was fun and I had a great time doing it, and being able to work with others to ask questions is a huge help! I am looking forward to more challenges and enhancing my knowledge over the next couple of months.
